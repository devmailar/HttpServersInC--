# Building an HTTP Server in C++ from Scratch

Why not try writing an HTTP server from scratch in C++? Itâ€™s not as hard as it sounds, and youâ€™ll learn a lot along the way how sockets work, what goes on under the hood of an HTTP request, and how to structure a basic server.

This project is a step-by-step experiment of building a minimal yet functional HTTP server. No frameworks, no shortcutsâ€”just raw sockets, some threading, and a lot of C++.

## Whatâ€™s Inside

## How Does It Work?

## Why Do This?

Building an HTTP server from scratch gives you a whole new appreciation for the tools you use daily. Youâ€™ll understand how servers process requests, how HTTP works at a fundamental level, and how to handle low-level networking. Plus, itâ€™s a fun project that makes you a better programmer! ðŸ¤–
